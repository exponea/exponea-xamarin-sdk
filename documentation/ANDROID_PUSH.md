## ðŸ“£  Android Push Notifications

Exponea allows you to easily create complex scenarios which you can use to send push notifications directly to your customers. The following section explains how to enable push notifications.

## Quickstart

For push notifications to work, you'll need to set up a few things:
- create a Firebase project
- integrate Firebase into your application 
- set the Firebase server key in the Exponea web app
- add a broadcast listener for opening push notifications

## Automatic tracking of Push Notifications

In the [Exponea SDK configuration](CONFIG.md), you can enable or disable the automatic push notification tracking by setting the Boolean value to the `AutomaticPushNotification` property and potentially setting up the desired frequency to the `TokenTrackFrequency`(default value is ON_TOKEN_CHANGE).

With `AutomaticPushNotification` enabled, the SDK will correctly display push notifications from Exponea and track a "campaign" event for every delivered/opened push notification with the correct properties.

## Other push providers / custom FirebaseMessagingService

Our automatic tracking relies on our implementation of FirebaseMessagingService.
In case you want to use your own FirebaseMessagingService, you have to call Exponea methods for handling push notifications and token yourself.
``` csharp
[Service(Name = "XamarinExample.Droid.ExampleFirebaseMessageService")]
    [IntentFilter(new[] { "com.google.firebase.MESSAGING_EVENT" })]
    [IntentFilter(new[] { "com.google.firebase.INSTANCE_ID_EVENT" })]
    public class ExampleFirebaseMessageService : FirebaseMessagingService
    {
        public override void OnMessageReceived(RemoteMessage message)
        { 
            var notificationManager = (NotificationManager)GetSystemService(NotificationService);
            if (!ExponeaNotificationHandler.Instance.HandleRemoteMessage(ApplicationContext, message, notificationManager, true)) {
                // push notification is from another push provider
            }
        }

        public override void OnNewToken(string token)
        {
            ExponeaNotificationHandler.Instance.TrackPushToken(token);
        }
    }
```

Exponea SDK will only handle push notification messages coming from Exponea servers. You can also use the helper method `IsExponeaNotification()`.

## Responding to Push notifications

When creating a notification using Exponea Web App, you can choose from 3 different actions to be used when tapping the message or additional buttons on a notification.

### 1. Open app
Open app action generates an intent with action `com.exponea.sdk.action.PUSH_CLICKED`. To respond to it, you need to set up a BroadcastReceiver.

``` csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using Android.App;
using Android.Content;
using ExponeaSdk.Services;
using ExponeaSdk.Models;

namespace XamarinExample.Droid
{
    [BroadcastReceiver(Enabled = true, Exported = true)]
    [IntentFilter(new[] { "com.exponea.sdk.action.PUSH_CLICKED" })]
    public class MyReceiver : BroadcastReceiver
    {
        public override void OnReceive(Context context, Intent intent)
        {
            // Extract payload data

            NotificationData value = (NotificationData)intent.GetParcelableExtra(ExponeaPushReceiver.ExtraData);

            // Process the data if you need to
            foreach (KeyValuePair<string, Java.Lang.Object> entry in value.Attributes)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(entry.Key + ":" + entry.Value);
            }
            
            // Start an activity
            var newIntent = new Intent(context, typeof(MainActivity));
            newIntent.AddFlags(ActivityFlags.NewTask);
            context.StartActivity(newIntent);
        }
    }
}
```

In the BroadcastReceiver, you can launch a corresponding activity(e.g., your main activity). Campaign data is included in the intent as `ExponeaPushReceiver.ExtraData`.


### 2. Deep-link
Deep-link action creates "view" intent that contains the URL specified when setting up this action. To respond to this intent, create an intent filter on the activity that should handle it. 
``` csharp
[IntentFilter(new[] { Intent.ActionView },
        Categories = new[] { Intent.CategoryDefault, Intent.CategoryBrowsable },
        DataScheme = "your_scheme",
        DataHost = "your_host",
        DataPathPattern = "your_path_pattern",
        AutoVerify = true
    )]
    public class MainActivity : global::Xamarin.Forms.Platform.Android.FormsAppCompatActivity
    {
        ...
```

### 3. Open web browser
The open web browser action is handled automatically by the SDK, and no work is required from the developer to handle it.

## Handling notification payload extra data
  You can set up notifications to contain an extra data payload. Whenever a message arrives, the Exponea SDK will call `NotificationDataCallback` that you can set on the `ExponeaNotificationHandler` instance. The extras are a `Dictionary<string, object>`.

#### ðŸ’» Usage

``` csharp
Action<Dictionary<string, object>> action = (extra) =>
            {
                //handle extra values
            };
ExponeaNotificationHandler.Instance.SetNotificationDataCallback(action);
```

Note that if previous data was received and no listener was attached to the callback, that data will be dispatched as soon as a listener is attached.

> If your app is not running in the background, the SDK will auto-initialize when a push notification is received. In this case, `NotificationDataCallback` is not set, so the callback will be called after attaching the listener(next app start). If you need to respond to the notification received immediately, implement your own `FirebaseMessagingService` and set the notification data callback in the `OnMessageReceived` function before calling `HandleRemoteMessage` on the ExponeaNotificationHandler instance. 


## Silent push notifications
Exponea web app allows you to set up silent push notifications that are not displayed to the user. The SDK tracks `campaign` event when the push notification is delivered, just like for regular notifications. There is no opening for those notifications, but if you have set up extra data in the payload, the SDK will call `NotificationDataCallback` as described in [Handling notification payload extra data](#handling-notification-payload-extra-data).

## Manual tracking of Push Notifications
If you decide to deactivate the automatic push notification or wish to track push notifications from other providers, you can still track events manually.

#### Track Push Token (FCM)

``` csharp
 _exponea.TrackPushToken("382d4221-3441-44b7-a676-3eb5f515157f");
```

#### Track Delivered Push Notification

``` csharp
 _exponea.Track(new Delivery { ["campaign_id"] = "id" });
```


#### Track Clicked Push Notification

``` csharp
 _exponea.Track(new Click("action-type", "action-name") { ["campaign_name"] = "My campaign" });
```
